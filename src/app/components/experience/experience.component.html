          <p>
            As the investigation graphing tool (“iGraph”) gained traction, I transitioned from leading its initial
            development into a Principal Engineer role—driving its evolution into an ecosystem of integrated tools
            tailored for blockchain investigation. My focus expanded to long-term strategy, scalable architecture,
            and enhancing investigative workflows through thoughtful tool integration. I also began incorporating AI
            capabilities into both the product and development environment.
            <br><br>
            I’ve continued to define and maintain the product roadmap and architectural decisions.
            While guiding strategy, I remain deeply hands-on—refactoring infrastructure to support new capabilities,
            resolving complex issues, and collaborating closely with my team. In parallel,
            I’ve worked to advance our engineering standards, streamline processes, and foster a culture rooted in simplicity,
            technical clarity, and clean code principles that promote maintainability and reliable delivery.

          <h4>Blockchain Visualization Project Lead</h4>
          <p>Led the design and development of the investigation graphing tool (“iGraph”), empowering blockchain investigators with advanced visualization, tracking, and analytical capabilities.
            <br><br>
            I managed nearly the entire software lifecycle—including product planning, roadmap definition, and integrating client feedback. Early in the project, I designed and implemented the UI/UX, made key architectural decisions, and took on the bulk of coding and maintenance myself.
            <br><br>
            As the project matured, I gained more resources and began delegating development tasks, enabling me to focus on high-level architecture, optimizing workflows, and ensuring timely milestone delivery. This phase deepened my understanding of the domain and laid the groundwork for long-term architectural strategy.
