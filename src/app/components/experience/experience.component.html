          <p>
            I joined as a senior frontend developer and quickly recognized untapped potential in our graphing tool.
            The legacy system was limiting both customer engagement and scalability, so I initiated a complete reimagining of the investigation graph.
            <br><br>
            In the early stages, I built the proof of concept independently—handling everything from architecture to UI.
            As the product gained traction, I was given the opportunity to lead a team that fluctuated between 2 to 5 developers.
            This transition enabled deeper collaboration with other teams and end users, and allowed me to focus on roadmap planning, feedback loops, and product vision, while still staying hands-on with architecture and complex coding challenges.
            The result was a modern, intuitive tool that quickly became our customers’ favorite interface replacing the old system and significantly improving adoption.
            <br><br>
            The frontend stack was primarily built with <b>Angular (versions 4 through 18)</b>, and the graphing tool leveraged <b>KeyLines</b> for data visualization. As the project matured, we adopted a <b>monorepo architecture using Nx (Narwhal)</b> to establish clearer boundaries and better manage dependencies across frontend projects.

            <br><br>
            More recently, I’ve been exploring the intersection of <b>LLMs and developer productivity</b>.
            We launched beta-stage, user-facing features for Ethereum contract analysis and graph-to-report generation.
            Internally, we’ve been integrating AI tools to reduce repetitive tasks and accelerate development—bringing in solutions like <b>UXPilot</b>, <b>GitHub Copilot for code reviews</b>, <b>Cursor</b>, and <b>WebStorm Junie</b>, which has proven to be a powerful addition to our workflow.
            <br><br>
